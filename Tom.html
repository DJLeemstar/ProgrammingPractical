        <title>Media Manipulation</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Media Manipulation</h1>
        <p>Broken down to its simplest form, an image is just a collection of pixels with a certain resolution and file format. A video is just a collection of images strung together with certain parameters. With these forms of media being as simple as they are, it's relatively simple to manipulate them using basic computer-enabled tools and algorithms, for a vast array of purposes and results.</p>
        <h2>Basic adjustment</h2>
        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>Given that the pixels comprising an image are defined by only a few numerical values, it's easy for a computer to adjust those values to create a certain effect.</p>
        <p>Some of the simplest changes that can be made are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brightness</li>
            <li>Contrast</li>
            <li>Hue</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And all of these can be achieved by shifting the three RGB colour values.</p>
        <p>For example, with 8-bit RGB colour space, a pixel may be defined as (x,y,z), where all three values are in the interval [0,255].</p>
        <p>Increasing brightness would involve increasing all 3 values, increasing contrast would involve moving the values further from the median point, and changing hue would involve increasing some values and decreasing others.</p>
        <figure style="margin: 0%;">
            <img src="histogram.png" alt="An image with histogram before and after the contrast is raised" width="500px">
            <figcaption>An image given increased contrast, as shown by the range of values on each histogram</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>These basic features and others like them are present on most consumer-grade image handling software, such as Photoshop, Instagram, and even Preview.</p>
        <p>More complex algorithms are able to produce more interesting effects, such as:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Removing the background of an image by setting all pixels in a certain area to be completely transparent
                <ul>
                    <li>Transparency is controlled by a forth value, called the alpha channel</li>
                    <li>Identifying the area to be altered is usually the most difficult part, and often requires manual adjustment by the user</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Converting an image from one filetype to another
                <ul>
                    <li>Different image filetypes support different attributes, such as transparency (present in .png files but not .jpg files)</li>
                    <li>Different filetypes often use different levels of image compression, which reduces the file size and sometimes loses visual information in the process</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Identifying faces or other recognisable objects in an image
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This is exceptionally useful for algorithms which automatically organise and label collections of images, such as Apple's Photos app
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        However, this technology still has a long way to go, as demonstrated by the relative effectiveness of CAPTCHA tests and the common mistakes made by content filters (such as believing sand dunes to be inappropriate images)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Noise reduction
                <ul>
                    <li>Able to reverse the effects of compression, such as JPEG artifacts</li>
                    <li>Also able to clean up the effects of electronic noise, baked into the image by the camera that captured it</li>
                    <li>Excessive noise reduction can lead to a loss of detail</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        </figure>
        <p>All these tools assist image analysis and make it far easier to produce better-looking images in a format suitable for their intended use. Advancements made in basic image-adjustment algorithms are incredibly useful and are frequently used by the vast majority of people in digitally developed nations.</p>
        <h3>Videos</h3>
        <p>Algorithm-based video editing is much less widely used, but is just as useful for the people who need it.</p>
        <p>Many consumer-grade algorithms of this nature are included in high-end editing software, such as Premiere, After Effects, and Final Cut Pro.</p>
        <p>Some features enabled by algorithms are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Video stabilisation</li>
            <li>Motion blur</li>
            <li>Increasing framerate</li>
        </ul>
        <figure style="margin: 0%;">
            <img src="stabilisation.jpg" alt="Editing software carrying out video stabilisation" width="700px">
            <figcaption>A stabilisation algorithm which keeps the recognisable pixels in the red boxes inside the green boxes, by subtly stretching and moving each frame</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>There have been concerns raised over the use of modern editing capabilities to 'improve' older video files, such as in the following instances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                George Lucas's 'Special Editions' of the original Star Wars Trilogy and 'Director's Cut' of his previous film THX-1138
                <ul>
                    <li>These made use of modern visual effects and compositing technology to alter many scenes, and to insert some entirely new ones.</li>
                    <li>The changes made are widely criticised, mostly due to the fact that the original versions of the films are no longer widely available</li>
                    <li>The fact that modern computing technology can be used to essentially overwrite previously existing versions of films is therefore a great source of concern for many</li>
                </ul>
                <figure style="margin-left: 0%;">
                    <img src="specialedition.jpg" alt="Changes made in the special edition" width="550px">

                </figure>
            </li>
            <li>
                The artificial increase of the framerate of videos through AI-based interpolation
                <ul>
                    <li>This is made possible through software such as <a href="https://grisk.itch.io/dain-app">DAIN</a>, which analyses the movement of pixels from frame to frame to interpret images that may have come in-between</li>
                    <li>However, many believe there to be serious artistic rammifications to using this technology on videos which are hand-animated</li>
                    <li>The software both overwrites the original sequence of frames, which were drawn by the artist to portray motion of a certain energy and style, and occasionally inserts frames with noticable 'smears' and inconsistencies</li>
                </ul>
                <figure style="margin-left: 0%;">

                </figure>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>More advanced applications</h2>
        <h3>Digital art</h3>
        <p>All the applications of computer algorithms discussed so far have aimed to enhance media and media analysis without changing the basic purpose of the media. While framerate interpolation and 'special editions' of films may slightly alter the artistic intent of the work, the work is still intended to be viewed in the same fashion by its consumers. However, digital manipulation can also be used to alter a piece of media to such an extent that the manipulation becomes a work of artistic expression in its own right.</p>
        <p>Consider, for example, the AI-enabled tools available at the <a href="https://deepdreamgenerator.com/">Deep Dream Generator</a>, which are able to blend together two images/textures in a variety of ways to produce a completely visually distinct result:</p>
        <figure style="margin-left: 0%;">
            <img src="deepstyle.jpg" alt="A merging of a woman's face and a painting of the ocean" width="450px">
            <figcaption>An application of the 'Deep Style' tool</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure style="margin-left: 0%;">
            <img src="thinstyle.jpg" alt="A merging of a man's face and a painting of a cottage" width="450px">
            <figcaption>An application of the 'Thin Style' tool</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>These tools emerged from the original 'Deep Dream' tool, which was initially "invented to help scientists and engineers to see what a deep neural network is seeing when it is looking in a given image", but evolved into "a new form of psychedelic and abstract art".</p>
        <figure style="margin-left: 0%;">
            <img src="deepdream.jpg" alt="A merging of architecture, eyeballs, and animals" width="450px">
            <figcaption>An application of the original 'Deep Dream' tool</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>A simpler use of modern image manipulation software is animating still images. The <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/deep-nostalgia">Deep Nostalgia</a> tool provided by MyHeritage is perhaps the most well-known example.</p>
        <figure style="margin-left: 0%;">

            <figcaption>The original image</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure style="margin-left: 0%;">
            <img src="skywalkermove.gif" alt="An animated video of Luke Skywalker" width="450px">
            <figcaption>The image given motion by MyHeritage</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>While the technology on display here is certainly impressive, there remains an eerie quality to the final result, similar to the 'uncanny valley' effect caused by <strong>near</strong>-identical replications of the human form.</p>
        <p>Displayed in this section are just a handful of the many artistic applications of image manipulation algorithms. Advancements in computer science have enabled the emergence of new forms of art, evolved from the building blocks of simple image adjustment techniques.</p>
