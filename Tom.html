        <h1>Media Manipulation</h1>
        <p>Broken down to its simplest form, an image is just a collection of pixels with a certain resolution and file format. A video is just a collection of images strung together with certain parameters. With these forms of media being as simple as they are, it's relatively simple to manipulate them using basic computer-enabled tools and algorithms, for a vast array of purposes and results.</p>
        <h2>Basic adjustment</h2>
        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>Given that the pixels comprising an image are defined by only a few numerical values, it's easy for a computer to adjust those values to create a certain effect.</p>
        <p>Some of the simplest changes that can be made are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brightness</li>
            <li>Contrast</li>
            <li>Hue</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And all of these can be achieved by shifting the three RGB colour values.</p>
        <p>For example, with 8-bit RGB colour space, a pixel may be defined as (x,y,z), where all three values are in the interval [0,255].</p>
        <p>Increasing brightness would involve increasing all 3 values, increasing contrast would involve moving the values further from the median point, and changing hue would involve increasing some values and decreasing others.</p>
        <figure style="margin: 0%;">
            <img src="histogram.png" alt="An image with histogram before and after the contrast is raised" width="500px">
            <figcaption>An image given increased contrast, as shown by the range of values on each histogram</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>These basic features and others like them are present on most consumer-grade image handling software, such as Photoshop, Instagram, and even Preview.</p>
        <p>More complex algorithms are able to produce more interesting effects, such as:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Removing the background of an image by setting all pixels in a certain area to be completely transparent
                <ul>
                    <li>Transparency is controlled by a forth value, called the alpha channel</li>
                    <li>Identifying the area to be altered is usually the most difficult part, and often requires manual adjustment by the user</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Converting an image from one filetype to another
                <ul>
                    <li>Different image filetypes support different attributes, such as transparency (present in .png files but not .jpg files)</li>
                    <li>Different filetypes often use different levels of image compression, which reduces the file size and sometimes loses visual information in the process</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Identifying faces or other recognisable objects in an image
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This is exceptionally useful for algorithms which automatically organise and label collections of images, such as Apple's Photos app
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        However, this technology still has a long way to go, as demonstrated by the relative effectiveness of CAPTCHA tests and the common mistakes made by content filters (such as believing sand dunes to be inappropriate images)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All these tools assist image analysis and make it far easier to produce better-looking images in a format suitable for their intended use. Advancements made in basic image-adjustment algorithms are incredibly useful and are frequently used by the vast majority of people in digitally developed nations.</p>
        <h3>Videos</h3>
        <p>Algorithm-based video editing is much less widely used, but is just as useful for the people who need it.</p>
        <p>Many consumer-grade algorithms of this nature are included in high-end editing software, such as Premiere, After Effects, and Final Cut Pro.</p>
        <p>Some features enabled by algorithms are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Video stabilisation</li>
            <li>Motion blur</li>
            <li>Increasing framerate</li>
        </ul>
        <figure style="margin: 0%;">
            <img src="stabilisation.jpg" alt="Editing software carrying out video stabilisation" width="700px">
            <figcaption>A stabilisation algorithm which keeps the recognisable pixels in the red boxes inside the green boxes, by subtly stretching and moving each frame</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>There have been concerns raised over the use of modern editing capabilities to 'improve' older video files, such as in the following instances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                George Lucas's 'Special Editions' of the original Star Wars Trilogy and 'Director's Cut' of his previous film THX-1138
                <ul>
                    <li>These made use of modern visual effects and compositing technology to alter many scenes, and to insert some entirely new ones.</li>
                    <li>The changes made are widely criticised, mostly due to the fact that the original versions of the films are no longer widely available</li>
                    <li>The fact that modern computing technology can be used to essentially overwrite previously existing versions of films is therefore a great source of concern for many</li>
                </ul>
                <figure style="margin-left: 0%;">
                    <img src="specialedition.jpg" alt="Changes made in the special edition" width="550px">
                    <figcaption>Top: The original ending of Return of the Jedi / Bottom: The 'Special Edition'</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </li>
            <li>
                The artificial increase of the framerate of videos through AI-based interpolation
                <ul>
                    <li>This is made possible through software such as <a href="https://grisk.itch.io/dain-app">DAIN</a>, which analyses the movement of pixels from frame to frame to interpret images that may have come in-between</li>
                    <li>However, many believe there to be serious artistic rammifications to using this technology on videos which are hand-animated</li>
                    <li>The software both overwrites the original sequence of frames, which were drawn by the artist to portray motion of a certain energy and style, and occasionally inserts frames with noticable 'smears' and inconsistencies</li>
                </ul>
